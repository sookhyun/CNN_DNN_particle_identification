# CNN_DNN_particle_identification

This repository contains a jupyter-notebook that explores a hybrid method that combines Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network to enhance the particle-identification capabilities at a high-energy collider experiment, sPHENIX. The initial study focused on the electromagnetic (EM) particle identification using energy signatures on an EM calorimeter. It was performed within the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). 

Data were generated using standard sPHENIX detector simulation coresoftware and
