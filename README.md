# CNN+DNN particle identification

This repository contains a jupyter-notebook that explores a hybrid method that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) to enhance the particle-identification capabilities at a high-energy collider experiment, sPHENIX. An initial study was performed by a student within the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) under my direction. 

The initial study focused on the electromagnetic (EM) particle identification using energy signatures on an EM calorimeter. In particular, of main interest was the behavior of a pair of photons decayed from a neutral pion, where the angle between the decay photons decreases with the momentum and the energy clusters of the pair eventually become completely merged. 

Data were generated using standard sPHENIX detector simulation implemented in the coresoftware repository. A conventional approach to EM particle identification is based on fitting an expected EM shower profile to the measured shape of energy clusters. The probability of the fit serves as a cut, below which is regarded as unlikely to be an EM shower. As two photons get closer, the shape of thier energy clusters tends to deviate from the shower profile, lowering the probility of the fit. They are then discarded and not used for data analysis. An alternate approach to this task of particle identification is to deploy ML tools such as CNN and DNN.
