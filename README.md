# CNN_DNN_particle_identification

This repository contains a jupyter-notebook that explores a hybrid method that combines Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network to enhance the particle-identification capabilities at a high-energy collider experiment, sPHENIX. An initial study was performed within the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).
